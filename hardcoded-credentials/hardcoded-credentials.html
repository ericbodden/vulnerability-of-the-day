<h2>Hard-coded Credentials</h2>
<p>
	<b>Description. </b> See <a
		href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html">CWE-798</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Examples:</b> <a href="hardcoded-credentials.zip">hardcoded-credentials.zip</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mitigations: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Extract your credentials out to a properties file, then
		install your system with the proper permissions on that properties
		file.</li>
	<li>Corollary: don't include default passwords anyway, make the
		user define them upon installation</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Believe it or not, this is another common problem. It's a
		common misconception that you can keep secrets in your source code.</li>
	<li>Same kind of concept applies to encryption keys, or
		pseudo-random number generator seeds.</li>
	<li>Obfuscation isn't the answer because reverse engineering is
		easier than you think. (Takes time and some skill, which crowds
		have).</li>
	<li>License keys have had this problem. Many companies today
		resort to a remote authentication for license products. But even
		then, it's still a tough problem today for desktop client
		applications (e.g. Windows Genuine Advantage).</li>
	<li>Hardcoding credentials also breaks maintainability and
		deployability. What if your database password was guessed, and you
		had to change it?</li>
</ul>
