<h2>Hashing and Salt</h2>
<p>
	<b>Description. </b> See <a
		href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/759.html">CWE-759</a>. If
	an attacker breaks in to a system that provides authentication, they
	should not be able to access the passwords. Historically, people would
	hash (digest) algorithms to accomplish this. However, commonly-guessed
	passwords are still vulnerable, as attackers can make "rainbow
	tables", or digests of common passwords.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Examples:</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="hashing-salt.zip">hashing-salt.zip</a>. The given
		example is an authentication example that demonstrates the different
		ways you can store a password and still authenticate. User sets their
		password, which gets salted and then digested (hashed). Every time
		the user authenticates, the system then salts and digests the
		password, and checks the results.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Mitigations: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Append a secret "salt" string that only the server knows
		before digesting. This will make those digests unrecognizable.</li>
	<li>Make sure that the salt is set by the final user, not
		hardcoded or set by default. Server salt is like default passwords or
		PRNG seeds - secrets that users should set by default.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Don't ever store passwords in plain text. This means that
		your "reset password" feature, should <em>never</em> email passwords
		in plaintext (because you don't have that anymore!). If you ever
		notice a website that does this, they are not hashing their
		passwords.
	</li>
	<li>Don't make your salt easily guessable. Any long string is
		fine, since you won't need to remember again.</li>
</ul>
