<h2>OS Command Injection</h2>
<p>
	<b>Description. </b> See <a
		href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html">CWE-78</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Examples:</b> <a href="os-command-injection.zip">os-command-injection.zip</a>.
	Also, <a href="http://www.apacheweek.com/issues/02-03-22#security">Apache
		HTTPD for Windows</a> had an issue with this where they allowed the pipe
	(|) character. Here's the actual <a
		href="http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&sortby=rev&revision=94092">SVN
		commit</a> for the fix, which involves additional logic for escaping
	characters.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mitigations: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Many languages allow limiting an OS call to a single command,
		which can limit the injection.</li>
	<li>Generally speaking, be very careful with OS calls. Avoid, if
		possible. Usually, APIs exist that can accomplish the same thing.</li>
	<li>Only allow certain input to these commands, as opposed to
		blocking or escaping bad output.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Web application technologies like PHP and Ruby on Rails make
		these OS calls very easy these days. These are very dangerous, as
		getting access to the underlying web server can have a huge impact.</li>
	<li>It's tempting to think you can just use a quick grep function
		or call a separate script, but be sure to think twice about that
		interaction.</li>
