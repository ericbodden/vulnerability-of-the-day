<h2>SQL Injection</h2>
<p>
	<b>Description. </b> See <a
		href="http://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html">CWE-89</a>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Examples:</b> <a href="sql-injection.zip">sql-injection.zip</a>.
</p>
<p>
	<b>Mitigations: </b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <b>only</b> acceptable mitigation are properly-used
		prepared statements. These API calls are supported by all SQL
		standards, and separate the logic of the query from its input
		entirely (i.e. pre-compile the SQL). No string concatenation should
		be used.
	</li>
	<li>Escaping characters has proven to be a poor substitute, as
		changing character sets makes this too hard.</li>
	<li>Using an OO-relational mapper (e.g. Hibernate) can mitigate
		this. However, string concatenation on the Hibernate query language
		can result in basically the same thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<b>Notes</b>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Currently the top problem on the CWE Top 25 vulnerabilities.
		Very common today.</li>
	<li>Can be done in all languages: Java, Ruby, PHP</li>
	<li>Not particularly hard to find or fix, you just have to know
		about it.</li>
	<li>A lot of people will tell you that you need lots of tools to
		fix SQL injection. It's all snakeoil... just use prepared statements.</li>
