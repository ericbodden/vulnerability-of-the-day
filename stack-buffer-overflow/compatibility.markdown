Known Compatability Issues
==========================

The current makefile is set to work under this config:

`3.2.0-27-generic #43-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 6 14:25:57 UTC 2012 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

Other versions of Linux or other OS's may require some tweaking to the exploit to make it work.
