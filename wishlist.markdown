Wishlist
========

The following is a wishlist of vulnerabilities we want to add or perfect in the future

* Buffer Overflow needs a better exploit, preferrably overriding the stack pointer would be ideal, but this is architecture-dependent.
* A better PRNG crack that breaks `java.util.Random`, but doesn't break `SecureRandom`
* Some more web vulnerabilities
