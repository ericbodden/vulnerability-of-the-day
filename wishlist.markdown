Wishlist
========

The following is a wishlist of vulnerabilities we want to add or perfect in the future

* Buffer Overflow needs a better exploit, preferrably overriding the stack pointer would be ideal, but this is architecture-dependent.
* A better PRNG crack that breaks `java.util.Random`, but doesn't break `SecureRandom`
* Some more web vulnerabilities, ones that demonstrate different concepts than just injection
* OS command injection needs an "even better" coding example that uses the underlying API

Ideas for new VotDs

* Cache poisoning. Dig up the details on the ARP and DNS cache poisoning vulnerability. Make a simple cache and show how it works conceptually
* Core dumps. Information disclosure through core dump files. Show how to trace through them, and how to configure so they're turned off
* PHP include vulnerabilities.
